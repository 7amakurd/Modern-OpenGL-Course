Hello this is your quiz.

Quiz: 
you need to set a uniform in fragmentShader and give (sin or cos) value between 0.0f - 1.0f  and then multiply this to 
"ourColor" (Color Attribute of the shape).

like this-> : FragColor = vec4(ourColor * myUniform, 1.0f);

NOTE: All sides (Vertices)'s color should be change with sin or cos value only one of them.
